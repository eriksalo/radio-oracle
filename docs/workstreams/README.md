# Workstreams

Radio Oracle is split into **8 independent workstreams**. Each has its own
folder of code, its own tests, its own settings prefix, and a documented way
to develop and exercise it in isolation. Pick one, ignore the others.

| #   | Workstream                                | Status         | Code lives in                              |

| [1](1-electronics.md)  | Electronics & Wiring                | Hardware loop done | `oracle/hardware/`, `docs/wiring/`     |
| [2](2-rag.md)          | Large-data ingest / RAG             | Working E2E (workstation) | `oracle/rag/`, `scripts/ingest_*.py`   |

## How to pick a workstream and start

1. Open the workstream's doc.
2. Skim **Scope** and **File ownership** — those tell you exactly what's
   yours to change.
3. Run the **Standalone exercise** section to confirm the workstream works
   end-to-end on your machine before touching anything.
4. Make changes only inside that workstream's owned files. If you find
   yourself editing a file owned by another workstream, the change probably
   belongs in *its* doc as a TODO instead.

## Cross-workstream rules

- **Settings**: each workstream owns an env-var prefix under `ORACLE_*`
  (e.g., `ORACLE_LED_*`, `ORACLE_MUSIC_*`). All defaults live in
  `config/settings.py`.
- **Lazy imports**: where one workstream consumes another, the import is
  done inside the function that needs it and wrapped in a try/except, so
  a missing dep degrades gracefully instead of crashing startup. See
  `oracle/core.py::_try_rag_query` for the pattern.
- **Interfaces are documented in each workstream's doc** under
  *Interface contract*. Don't add a new cross-workstream call without
  updating both docs.
- **Tests** go in `tests/test_<workstream-thing>.py`. Each workstream's doc
  lists its own tests under *Standalone exercise*.

8. Diagnostics — reads metrics from all of the above; depended on by none.
```

Workstreams above the line consume those below. Nothing flows the other way,
so you can stub or break a downstream workstream without affecting upstream
ones (the lazy-import pattern handles missing deps).
